# Elevate Labs - Data Analyst Internship | Task 2: Data Visualization and Storytelling

---

### 🚀 Objective

[cite_start]The goal of this task was to create a set of visualizations using the Superstore dataset to convey a compelling story, focusing on actionable business insights rather than just aesthetics[cite: 6, 5].

### 🛠️ Tools and Deliverables

* **Dataset:** SuperstoreDataSet (.xlsx)
* **Tool:** Microsoft Power BI Desktop
* **Deliverables:** Power BI file (.pbix) and Dashboard Screenshots/PDF Report.

### 📊 The Business Story: Optimizing Profitability

[cite_start]The visualization story was structured to identify where the Superstore business is losing money and recommend specific areas for intervention, directly addressing the need to focus on business insights[cite: 5].

#### 1. The Big Picture: Inconsistent Profitability

* **Visual:** Line Chart (Sales and Profit over Time)
* **Insight:** While overall Sales show a healthy growth trend, the Profit trend is erratic and inconsistent across the years, suggesting underlying inefficiencies that need investigation.

#### 2. Root Cause: Problem Areas

* **Visual:** Clustered Column Chart (Profit by Category) and Map Visual (Profit by State)
* **Insight:** The business suffers from significant negative profit contribution from the **[Category with worst profit, e.g., Furniture]** category. Geographically, concentrated losses in states like **[State with large negative profit bubble, e.g., Texas, Pennsylvania]** are driving down the overall bottom line.

#### 3. Actionable Focus: High-Sales, Low-Profit Items

* **Visual:** Scatter Plot (Sales vs. Profit, detailed by Sub-Category)
* **Insight:** The scatter plot highlights specific "problem children"—products with high revenue but minimal or negative profit (e.g., **Tables**, **Bookcases**). Management should urgently review the pricing and operational costs (shipping/storage) for these items to convert them into profitable sales.

### ✨ Dashboard Design Highlights (Best Practices)

]The dashboard was designed following visualization best practices [cite: 24] to ensure clarity and impact:

* **Clarity:** A clean layout was used, and colors were used judiciously, primarily to highlight key negative takeaways (e.g., using red for negative profit on the map and bar charts)[cite: 11, 12].
* **Context:** Each chart was given a clear title and context to communicate its purpose[cite: 13].
* **Interactivity:** Slicers were included for **Year** and **Region** to allow users to quickly filter the data and conduct ad-hoc regional analysis.

### 🔑 Key Takeaways for Management

Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended:

1.  **Cost Review:** Immediately investigate the cost structure of high-sales, low-profit Sub-Categories like Tables and Bookcases.
2.  **Geographic Strategy:** Develop targeted strategies to reduce losses in the identified underperforming states/regions.
3.  **Category Focus:** Focus promotional efforts and pricing adjustments on the **[Most profitable Category, e.g., Technology]** to capitalize on proven profitable segments.
